● Usage:
m Although some commentators insist that ~ be restricted to instances in which the alternatives
to be chosen are equally unsatisfactory, their concern is misplaced; the unsatisfactoriness of the
options is usually a matter of how the author presents them. What is distressing or painful
about a ~ is having to make a choice one does not want to make. The use of such adjectives as
terrible, painful, and irreconcilable suggests that ~ is losing some of its unpleasant force. There
also seems to be a tendency especially in sense 3b toward applying the word to less weighty
problems zuoxiesolved their goaltending ~ — Pat Calabriayouxie.

curiosity is the lifeblood of real civilization — G. M. Trevelyanyouxie
● Synonyms: see indifferent
● ? ~ly adverb
● Usage:
m Disinterested and uninterested have a tangled history. Uninterested originally meant impartial,
but this sense fell into disuse during the 18th century. About the same time the original sense
of ~ also disappeared, with uninterested developing a new sense—the present meaning—to
take its place. The original sense of uninterested is still out of use, but the original sense of ~
revived in the early 20th century. The revival has since been under frequent attack as an
illiteracy and a blurring or loss of a useful distinction. Actual usage shows otherwise. Sense 2 of
~ is still its most frequent sense, especially in edited prose; it shows no sign of vanishing. A
careful writer may choose sense 1a of ~ in preference to uninterested for emphasis
zuoxieteaching the letters of the alphabet to her wiggling and supremely ~ little daughter — C.
L. Sulzbergeryouxie. Further, ~ has developed a sense (1b), perhaps influenced by sense 1 of
the prefix dis-, that contrasts with uninterested zuoxiewhen I grow tired or ~ in anything, I
experience a disgust — Jack London (letter, 1914)youxie. Still, use of senses 1a and 1b will
incur the disapproval of some who may not fully appreciate the history of this word or the
subtleties of its present use.

● n. 长处, 擅长; adj. ( 音乐) 强音的
● ［英］ n. 长处, 擅长 ( special accomplishment or strong point) ; adj. ( 音乐) 强音的 ( a forte note
or passage)
Webster Collegiate
I. noun
● Etymology: French fort, from fort, adjective, strong
● Date: circa 1648
● 1. the part of a sword or foil blade that is between the middle and the hilt and that is the strongest part
of the blade
● 2. one's strong point
● Usage:
m In ~ we have a word derived from French that in its “strong point” sense has no entirely
satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \\?fo?r-?tā\\ and \\?fo?r-tē\\
because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived ［sup］2［/sup］~. Their
recommended pronunciation \\?fo?rt\\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the
French would write the word le fort and would rhyme it with English for. So you can take your
choice, knowing that someone somewhere will dislike whichever variant you choose. All are
standard, however. In British English \\?fo?-?tā\\ and \\?fo?t\\ predominate; \\?fo?r-?tā\\
and \\fo?r-?tā\\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.
II. adverb or adjective

● ? ~ly adverb
● ? ~ness noun
● Usage:
m The senses shown above are the chief living senses of ~. Sense 2, which was a generalized term
of disparagement in the late 17th century, is the least common of these. Fulsome became a
point of dispute when sense 1, thought to be obsolete in the 19th century, began to be revived
in the 20th. The dispute was exacerbated by the fact that the large dictionaries of the first half of
the century missed the beginnings of the revival. Sense 1 has not only been revived but has
spread in its application and continues to do so. The chief danger for the user of ~ is
ambiguity. Unless the context is made very clear, the reader or hearer cannot be sure whether
such an expression as “~ praise” is meant in sense 1b or in sense 4.

● Usage:
m Sir Thomas More is the first writer known to have used both ~ and imply in their approved
senses (1528). He is also the first to have used ~ in a sense close in meaning to imply (1533).
Both of these uses of ~ coexisted without comment until some time around the end of World
War I. Since then, senses 3 and 4 of ~ have been frequently condemned as an undesirable
blurring of a useful distinction. The actual blurring has been done by the commentators. Sense
3, descended from More's use of 1533, does not occur with a personal subject. When
objections arose, they were to a use with a personal subject (now sense 4). Since dictionaries
did not recognize this use specifically, the objectors assumed that sense 3 was the one they
found illogical, even though it had been in respectable use for four centuries. The actual usage
condemned was a spoken one never used in logical discourse. At present sense 4 is found in
print chiefly in
